2. **Timezone Handling**: The application uses the moment-timezone library to handle timezones, ensuring accurate time representation for the Damascus timezone.

4. **Documentation**: Comments and clear variable/function names are used to enhance code understanding.

## Testing
   - Unit tests are implemented to ensure functionality correctness.
