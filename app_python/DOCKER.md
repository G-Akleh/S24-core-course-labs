# Docker Best Practices

In this Dockerfile, we've implemented several Docker best practices to ensure security, efficiency, and maintainability.

## Implemented Best Practices:

1. **Rootless Container**:

   - We create a non-root user (`user`) to run the application, enhancing security.

2. **Use of COPY with Specific Files**:

   - We utilize the `COPY` instruction to copy specific files (`requirements.txt` and application files) into the image, reducing unnecessary data transfer and ensuring only required files are included.

3. **Layer Sanity**:

   - We optimize Dockerfile layers to ensure changes are applied efficiently. Similar instructions are grouped together to minimize the number of layers created.

4. **Use of .dockerignore**:

   - We use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being copied into the image, reducing its size and improving build performance.

5. **Precise Version of Base Image and Language**:
   - We specify a precise version of the base image (`python:3.9-slim`) and language to ensure reproducibility and avoid potential compatibility issues with future versions.
